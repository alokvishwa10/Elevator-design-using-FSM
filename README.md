# Elevator-design-using-FSM
Design and simulation of FSM based Elevator in Xilinx Vivado

In this verilog code I have tried to replicate realworld Elevator design and used a binary encoding scheme for encoding of the states, 
This works on the clock provided and the external input given by the user.
Depending on the present state (Floor) the elevator is in and the floor input given by the user, The elevator acts upon the input by traversing through each of the state sequentially rather than jumping onto the floor directly(which  is exact replica of real-world elevator)
